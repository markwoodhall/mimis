* Why?

  Mimis is an attempt to "formalise" my neovim configuration into something re-usable and
  stable. 

  In many ways it's very bespoke and in the true sense of a PDE (Personalised Development Environment), it's
  built for one. I hope that it might serve as inspiration and be useful to others, but as of right now, that isn't
  the end goal. 

  Many of the choices made have been inspired by nearly 20 years of using vim as well as an observation of emacs, and how
  text editors and IDEs have evolved. 

  I am a lover of lisp, so this wouldn't be my config if it wasn't powered by the fantastic Fennel lang. 

  Fennel compiles to lua and is used to build this neovim configuration.

* About this documentation

  This documentation is built using this neovim configuration. A combination of nvim-orgmode and the Mimis notes module.
